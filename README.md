# Lab4
This is the fourth coding assignment (Lab 4) of the semester in CSC 172 and I made this in eclipse. The objective of the lab was to implement some basic functionality for manipulating DNA and RNA sequences. This lab has 3 different classes. One of the classes is CommandLine.java which handles the commands affecting the DNA list. Another class is DNA.Java which uses nodes to get and set the current and next letters in the sequence, and also prints out the sequence. It essentially manages the construction and printing of the dna sequence. The last class is DnaList.java, which handles and manipulaties all the clipping, copying, removing, transcribing, and sequencing of the dna and rna information in the program.
